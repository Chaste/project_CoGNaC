= CoGNaC: a Chaste plugin for the multiscale simulation of Gene regulatory Networks driving the spatial dynamics of tissues and Cancer =

Welcome to CoGNaC.


Designed only to work as bolt-on project for Chaste v3.2

TODO Cite references here.

== Sample commands to install and run everything ==

Before running this simulation you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.

You will also need the Chaste source code for this project. It is available from the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html main Chaste download page] as extensions to Chaste release 3.2 under the projects heading, or you can [wiki:ChasteGuides/AccessCodeRepository access the source code direct from our repository].
Move the project in Chaste/projects where 'Chaste' is the folder containing the Chaste source code.

For the latter option, using a command-line subversion client, you can get the required code in a new folder called 'Chaste' with the commands:
{{{
#!sh
svn --username anonymous checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/tags/release_3.2 Chaste
cd Chaste/projects
svn checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/[Add project name here]
}}}
Use your email address as the password for the 'anonymous' account.

Once you have checked out the project you need to install [http://buddy.sourceforge.net/manual/main.html BuDDy] tool, you may do so from the command line as follows:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libbdd-dev
}}}

This will install BuDDy using the standard folders but you also need to inform Chaste to add BuDDy as library dependency,
adding this information to the hostconfing file.
Scons will tell you which machine file it's using in the first few lines, e.g:
{{{
cd path/to/Chaste
scons
 scons: Reading SConscript files ...
 Using hostconfig settings from python/hostconfig/ubuntu.py
 Running infrastructure tests...
}}}

So, in the file you are using (e.g. python/hostconfig/ubuntu.py), just add 'bdd' similar to:
{{{
other_libraries = boost_libs + ['xerces-c',
                                'hdf5', 'z',
                                'parmetis', 'metis', 'bdd']
}}}

Now the project should be installed, and everything should run correctly. In order to
test if everything is installed correctly, you can run some test, so
from a command line do:
{{{
scons test\_suite=projects/[Add a project name here]/test/TestArrayDirectedGraph.hpp
scons test\_suite=projects/[Add a project name here]/test/TestRandomBooleanNetwork.hpp
scons test\_suite=projects/[Add a project name here]/test/TestDifferentiationTree.hpp
scons test\_suite=projects/[Add a project name here]/test/TestDifferentiationTreeBasedCellCycleModel.hpp
}}}

If each test run is passed, you can start run some tutorial, or create your own test suites.

== How to compile and run tests ==

To run the test and simulations, use:
{{{
cd path/to/Chaste
scons test_suite=projects/[Add project name here]/test/TEST\_CLASS\_NAME.hpp
}}}

There are seven test suites in the projects:
TestDifferentiationTree.hpp - for testing DifferentiationTree class.
TestDifferentiationTreeBasedCellCycleModel.hpp - for testing the DifferentiationTreeBasedCellCycelModel class.
TestRandomBooleanNetwork.hpp - for testing the RandomBooleanNetwork class.
TestArrayDirectedGraph.hpp - for testing ArrayDirectedGraph and GraphNode classes.

TestCryptBasedSimulationsUsingDifferentiationTreeCellCycleModel.hpp - crypt simulations using DifferentiationTreeBasedCellCycelModel.
TestPottsBasedSimulationsUsingDifferentiationTreeCellCycleModel.hpp - CPM simulations using DifferentiationTreeBasedCellCycelModel.
TestWntDependentCryptUsingDifferentiationTreeCellCycleModel.hpp - Wnt dependent simulations using DifferentiationTreeBasedCellCycelModel.

'''NB''': Note that the code for simulations ''will not work'' with Chaste release 3.1 or earlier.
